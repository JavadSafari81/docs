#Web Server


#### Installing Nginx
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```
#### Adjusting the Firewall
Before testing Nginx, the firewall software needs to be adjusted to allow access to the service. Nginx registers itself as a service with ufw upon installation, making it straightforward to allow Nginx access.

List the application configurations that ufw knows how to work with by typing:
```
sudo ufw app list
```
You should get a listing of the application profiles:

```
Output
Available applications:
  Nginx Full
  Nginx HTTP
  Nginx HTTPS
  OpenSSH
```
It is recommended that you enable the most restrictive profile that will still allow the traffic youâ€™ve configured. Right now, we will only need to allow traffic on port 80.

You can enable this by typing: 
```
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
```
You can verify the change by typing:
```
sudo ufw status
```
#### Checking your Web Server
```
systemctl status nginx
``` 
You must see this:
```
Active: active (running) since Fri 2020-04-20 16:08:19 UTC;
```
You can now see your nginx default page in:
```
http://your_server_ip
http://188.121.111.85
```
